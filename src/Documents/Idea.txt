- Use series 2 to create Oracles since they have an objective (preparing tea)
- Create a different Oracle for each user, the oracle will be an automata generated from data
    -alphabet: all permutations of sensor/location/state
    -nodes: activities
    -edges: sensor data from previous activity to next one

    -accept when state 7 (preparing tea) is reached

-How to create The Oracles
    -easy but boring: by hand parsing the files and create the automaton
    -more interesting: let L* create the automaton from a simpler parsing of the files and a specific oracle to see if
        the input prepares tea
    -maybe they are the same thing since we need to tell the Oracle what to accept

- Try to merge different oracles
    -keep only common edges
    -add all the edges

- Check if different users' data gets accepted from different oracles
- Check if data for series 1 gets accepted
    - that could mean that someone made tea
- Try random words testing
